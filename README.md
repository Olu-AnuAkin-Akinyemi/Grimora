# Grimora

> *A living spellbook, as your companion*

**Grimora** is a digital grimoire—a structured learning companion for students of the **KemKnightRanger Academy (KRA)**. It weaves together mathematics, chemistry, physics, and engineering with the historical and philosophical roots of science in African alchemy (Khemia/Kimia) and the principle of Ma'at (balance, truth, and order).

---

## 🌟 Vision

Grimora transforms STEM education into an immersive journey where:
- **Mathematics** becomes symbolic "spells" of quantity and pattern
- **Chemistry** reveals the transformation of matter
- **Physics & Engineering** demonstrate applied motion, force, and design
- **Khemia/Alchemy lore** provides historical and philosophical context

This is not a gamified point-chasing app—it's a **living spellbook** that helps learners bring order to chaos and create with awareness, discipline, and curiosity.

## 🎯 Target Audience

**Age Range:** 13+ (8th grade through adult re-learners)

**Reading Level:** 7th–10th grade, with optional deeper study notes

**Personas:**

- **Young Initiates (13-16):** Curious students who want science to feel alive and meaningful
- **Returning Learners (17+):** Adults re-learning foundational concepts with renewed purpose
- **Guides/Mentors:** Teachers, parents, and tutors supporting learners

## 📚 Level 1: Initiate Chapter

### Four Halls of Grimora

**Level 1** introduces core foundations through four thematic "Halls":

#### 1. **Math Sanctum** 🔢

**Operations as Transformations**

- Addition ↔ Subtraction as opposite transformations
- Multiplication ↔ Division as scaling & unscaling
- Exponents ↔ Roots as "powering up" & "revealing the seed"

#### 2. **Matter Lab** ⚗️

**Matter & Elements**

- Understanding matter, mass, and volume
- States of matter (solid, liquid, gas, plasma)
- Atoms, molecules, and the periodic table

#### 3. **Hall of Ma'at** ⚖️

**Balance, Truth & Clear Thinking**

- Ma'at as a principle of balance and order
- The Trivium (Grammar, Logic, Rhetoric) in scientific thinking
- From Khemia to Chemistry: historical evolution

#### 4. **Machina Workshop** ⚙️

**Forces & Simple Machines**

- Understanding forces as pushes and pulls
- Balance vs. imbalance in physical systems
- Simple machines (lever, ramp, pulley, wheel)

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

**Front-End Only (Phase 1):**

- **HTML5** - Semantic structure
- **CSS3** - Styling and layout with backdrop-filter effects
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** - No frameworks, modular architecture
- **THREE.js** - 3D visualization and animation
- **JSDoc** - Comprehensive documentation
- **JSON/JS modules** - Content and configuration data

### 3D Visualization

- **Dual Canvas Architecture** - Separate THREE.js scenes for background and side panel
- **Raycasting for Interaction** - Mouse hover detection on 3D objects
- **WebGL Rendering** - Hardware-accelerated graphics with fallback support
- **Optimization** - Device pixel ratio scaling and viewport constraints

### Architecture Principles

**Separation of Concerns:**

- `core/` - Pure functions (no DOM, no side effects)
- `ui/` - DOM rendering and event handling
- `app/` - Orchestration and coordination
- `data/` - Content definitions and metadata

**Clean Code Practices:**

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Domain-Driven Design concepts
- Comprehensive JSDoc annotations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

None! Just a modern web browser.

### Running Locally

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Olu-AnuAkin-Akinyemi/Grimora.git
cd Grimora
```

Start an HTTP server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# or: python -m http.server 8000 (for Python 2)
```

Open in browser:

```bash
open http://localhost:8000/client/
```

### Development Notes

- All code is vanilla JavaScript (ES6+ modules) with no build step required
- Files are served fresh from disk; refresh your browser to see changes
- Open browser DevTools (F12) to debug and check for console errors
- THREE.js visualizations require WebGL support
