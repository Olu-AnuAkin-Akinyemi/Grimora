## 1. Lesson Snapshot

### Title  
Multiplication & Division: Scaling and Unscaling

### One-Sentence Summary  
Multiplication and division are scaling transformations: one stretches a quantity by repeated addition, and the other shrinks it back, undoing the scale.

### Learning Objectives – Learners will be able to…

- Describe multiplication as repeated addition / scaling up.  
- Describe division as repeated subtraction or equal sharing / scaling down.  
- Recognize division as the inverse of multiplication in simple cases.  
- Represent real-world scaling and sharing situations with multiplication and division.  
- See how these operations support later ideas in area, rates, and engineering design.

### Key Terms

- **Multiplication** – Combining equal groups; repeated addition.  
- **Division** – Splitting into equal groups; repeated subtraction.  
- **Factor** – A number being multiplied.  
- **Product** – Result of multiplication.  
- **Quotient** – Result of division.  
- **Inverse operation** – Operation that undoes another.

**Symbolic / Lore Flavor (metaphor only)**

- Multiplication as “amplifying” a spell/energy.  
- Division as “diluting” or “distributing” that energy fairly.  
  - (Optionally echo _Supreme Mathematic_ ideas of building and breaking down, but keep math rigorous.)

> [Deeper Study – Scaling as Structure]  
> For older learners, you can connect “factors” to how engineers think about
> **dimensions** (e.g., 3 rows × 4 columns in a panel) or how changing one
> factor scales area and load.

## 2. Narrative Hook

Short story:

- The Kimia apprentice has a base mixture that glows faintly.  
- The master says:
  - “Each spoonful of this powder multiplies the glow by the same amount.”  
  - Adding 1 spoonful is like `×2`, adding 2 spoonfuls might be like `×4`, etc.  
- Later, to share the potion fairly among 4 students, they **divide** the total into equal parts.

Hook ideas:

- Multiplication = “turning the dial up” in equal steps.  
- Division = “turning the dial down” by sharing or spreading out.

**Why This Matters (Now & Later)**

- **Now (daily life):**  
  - Figuring out total cost when you buy several of the same item.  
  - Splitting food, time, or money fairly between people.
- **Later (science & engineering):**  
  - Counting parts in arrays (solar panels, tiles, bolts).  
  - Working with area, rates (speed = distance ÷ time), and scaling designs up or down.

## 3. Prior Knowledge & Warm-Up

### 3.1 Assumed Prior Knowledge

- Comfortable with addition and subtraction of small whole numbers.  
- Understands “groups of” (e.g., “3 groups of 2 apples”).  
- Recognizes `×` and `÷` symbols, even if not fully fluent.

### 3.2 Quick Warm-Up (2–4 items)

- Show pictures of equal groups (e.g., 3 groups of 4) and ask:
  - “How many in each group?”  
  - “How many in total?”
- Quick recall:
  - “What is 4 + 4 + 4?” → then connect to `3 × 4`.  
  - “You have 12 objects. How many groups of 3 can you make?” → connect to `12 ÷ 3`.

---

## 4. Main Concept Explanation

### 4.1 Intuitive Explanation

- **Multiplication as equal groups / scaling:**
  - `3 × 4` → “3 groups of 4,” or “4 repeated 3 times.”  
  - Number line: jump in equal steps (4, 8, 12).  
  - Visual arrays: 3 rows of 4 dots.

- **Division as sharing / unscaling:**
  - `12 ÷ 3` → “split 12 into 3 equal groups” → 4 in each group.  
  - Or “How many 3s fit into 12?”

Connect:

- Multiplication = “zooming out” by equal jumps.  
- Division = “zooming in” to find how many jumps or how big each group is.

> [Deeper Study – From Groups to Area]  
> For learners ready to peek ahead, show that a 3 × 4 array is also the
> beginning of **area**: 3 units by 4 units makes 12 little squares.  
> This links arithmetic (number in itself) to geometry (number in space).

### 4.2 Formal / Semi-Formal Explanation

- Standard forms:
  - `a × b = c` → `a` groups of `b` → product `c`.  
  - `c ÷ b = a` → splitting `c` into `b` groups → quotient `a`.  
- Inverses:
  - If `3 × 4 = 12`, then:
    - `12 ÷ 3 = 4`  
    - `12 ÷ 4 = 3`

### 4.3 Worked Examples

1. **Groups of objects**  
   - “You have 5 bags with 3 marbles each. How many marbles in total?”  
     - `5 × 3 = 15`.

2. **Sharing**  
   - “You have 20 seeds to plant in 4 equal rows. How many seeds per row?”  
     - `20 ÷ 4 = 5`.

3. **Scaling up a recipe**  
   - “Recipe for 1 person uses 2 cups of water. How much for 3 people?”  
     - `3 × 2 = 6` cups.

4. **Scaling down / equal share**  
   - “You baked 18 cookies for 6 friends. If everyone gets the same amount, how many cookies per friend?”  
     - `18 ÷ 6 = 3`.

## 5. Guided Practice (with hints)

### 5.1 Practice Set (4–8 items)

Examples:

1. `3 × 5 = ?`  
   - Hint: Think 5 + 5 + 5.

2. `4 × ? = 16`  
   - Hint: “How many 4s make 16?”

3. `24 ÷ 6 = ?`  
   - Hint: “How many 6s fit into 24?”

4. `? ÷ 3 = 7`  
   - Hint: “What number, split into 3 equal groups, gives 7 in each group?”

5. Short word problem:  
   - “There are 4 teams with 6 players on each team. How many players total?”  
   - Hint: “Is this groups-of or sharing?”

---

## 6. Independent Practice

### 6.1 Practice Set (6–10 items)

Mix of:

- **Multiplication facts**  
  - `2 × 7`, `6 × 4`, `9 × 3`, `5 × 5`.

- **Division facts**  
  - `18 ÷ 3`, `20 ÷ 5`, `15 ÷ 3`, `24 ÷ 4`.

- **Word problems (2–3 items)**  
  - “A shelf has 3 rows of books with 8 books in each row. How many books?”  
  - “You have 30 beads and want to make 5 equal bracelets. How many beads per bracelet?”  

- **Explain your thinking (1–2 items)**  
  - “Explain in your own words how division ‘undoes’ multiplication.”

---

## 7. Reflection – “STEAM of Self”

### 7.1 Reflection Prompts

Prompt ideas (inspired by _STEAM of SELF – Curriculum Outline_):

- “Where in your life do you **scale up** effort (like studying more) or **scale down** distractions?”  
- “Think of one area where multiplying effort by a small factor (like 1.5×) would change your outcomes over time.”  
- “Is there a place in your day where you are ‘dividing’ your attention too much?”

---

## 8. Connection Forward

### 8.1 Where This Leads

- This lesson prepares learners to:
  - Understand **area** as rows × columns.  
  - Work with **rates** (e.g., speed = distance ÷ time, density = mass ÷ volume).  
  - Think about **scaling designs** up or down in engineering (e.g., doubling rows or columns in a solar panel or sensor grid).
- It sets up:
  - Lesson 1.3 – Exponents & Roots: Powering Up and Revealing the Seed, where repeated multiplication becomes its own operation.

## 9. Mini Quiz

### 9.1 Quiz (3–5 questions)

1. Compute: `4 × 6 = ?`  
2. Compute: `21 ÷ 3 = ?`  
3. A box has 4 rows of 5 apples. How many apples are in the box?  
4. You have 24 stickers and 6 friends. If you share them equally, how many stickers does each friend get?  
5. Explain: “Why are multiplication and division called inverse operations?”

### 9.2 Answer Key

1. `4 × 6 = 24`  
2. `21 ÷ 3 = 7`  
3. `4 × 5 = 20` apples  
4. `24 ÷ 6 = 4` stickers per friend  
5. Sample idea: “Multiplication combines equal groups into a bigger total, and division either splits a total into equal groups or asks how many equal groups fit into the total. Each can undo what the other did.”

## 12. PDF / Source Inspiration Map

- **_Supreme Mathematic – African Ma’at Magic – African Creative Energy_**  
  - Use for: metaphors of **building / breaking down**, structure, balance of forces.  
  - Keep all uses symbolic; do not turn them into arithmetic rules.

- **_STEAM of SELF – Curriculum Outline_**  
  - Use for: habit and effort “scaling” metaphors in Reflection section.  

- **Optional – _Real Alchemy – Key Excerpts_**  
  - Use as flavor for “amplifying” or “diluting” a mixture/potion in the Narrative Hook (as metaphor for scaling numbers).
