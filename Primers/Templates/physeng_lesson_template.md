- **Term** – short, student-friendly definition.

> [Deeper Study – Optional]  
> Brief note for older learners, e.g. a more formal definition or symbol.

---

## 2. NARRATIVE HOOK

### 2.1 Story / Scenario (3–6 sentences)

- A real-world or imaginative scenario, for example:
  - A bridge under load, a robot arm lifting, a falling object, a motor spinning, a satellite orbiting, a simple circuit powering a light.  
- Show the **tension** between what could go wrong and how understanding physics helps things go right.

### 2.2 Why This Matters

- **Everyday life:**  
  - Short bullets linking to common experiences (e.g., riding a bike, using tools, plugging in devices).
- **Future engineering / robotics / technology:**  
  - How this idea shows up in:
    - Mechanical / electrical design  
    - Robotics control  
    - Safety, efficiency, reliability  

---

## 3. PRIOR KNOWLEDGE & WARM-UP

### 3.1 Prior Knowledge

- List 2–4 ideas or skills assumed, e.g.:
  - Simple math operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)  
  - Basic idea of push / pull / motion / energy  
  - Reading simple graphs (if relevant)

### 3.2 Warm-Up Questions (2–4)

- Intuitive prompts like:
  - “What happens if you push a heavy box harder?”  
  - “Why is it easier to pull a suitcase on wheels than to drag it?”  
  - “What happens when too many devices are plugged into one outlet?”

> These should wake up intuition **before** formal terms appear.

---

## 4. MAIN CONCEPT EXPLANATION

### 4.1 Intuitive Explanation

- Use **everyday language and images**:
  - Pushing/pulling, sliding, falling, vibrating, flowing, rotating.  
- Describe what the learner might **see, feel, or notice**:
  - “The harder you push, the faster it starts to move,” etc.

### 4.2 Scientific Explanation

- Introduce the **physical concept** and **simple law(s)**:
  - e.g., force, mass, acceleration; energy transfer; velocity vs speed; current & voltage, etc.  
- Use:
  - Minimal equations  
  - Clear units  
  - Short, direct statements

> [Deeper Study – Optional]  
> Add a short note with a more formal law (e.g., Newton’s 2nd law, Ohm’s law),  
> clearly marked as “for deeper study.”

### 4.3 Worked Examples (3–5)

Each example should have:

1. **Short scenario**  
   - “A 10 N force pulls a small cart…”  
2. **Question**  
   - “What happens if we double the force?”  
3. **Explanation**  
   - In words and, if relevant, a simple calculation or diagram reference.

Examples can be:

- Simple free-body reasoning  
- Basic motion (faster / slower)  
- Very simple circuit reasoning (more bulbs, same battery, etc.)

## 5. ENGINEERING LAYER – FROM LAWS TO DESIGN

### 5.1 “Engineer’s View”

- A short paragraph:  
  - “A mechanical engineer uses this concept to…”  
  - “An electrical engineer uses this idea to…”  
  - “A robotics engineer must consider this when…”

Explain **how** the concept informs design decisions:  
- Safety margins  
- Material choice  
- Power needs  
- Stability and control

### 5.2 Micro Design Challenge (Conceptual)

- Tiny, low-stress design prompt, e.g.:

  - “You’re designing a ramp so a small robot can climb without slipping.  
     What could you change: the steepness, the surface, the force the motor can apply?”

- Ask 1–2 guiding questions:
  - “Which change is most realistic?”  
  - “How would you test your idea in a simple way?”

---

## 6. GUIDED PRACTICE (WITH HINTS)

### 6.1 Practice Set (4–6 items)

- Mix of:
  - Prediction questions (“What happens if…?”)  
  - Diagram choices (“Which sketch matches this description?”)  
  - Simple numeric questions (if appropriate).

For each item, include a **short hint**, e.g.:

- “Think about what happens when force increases but mass stays the same.”  
- “Which path would make the current larger: more voltage or more resistance?”

---

## 7. INDEPENDENT PRACTICE

### 7.1 Practice Set (6–10 items)

Include a blend of:

- **Simple calculations**  
  - Straightforward use of a single formula or proportion.  
- **Conceptual questions**  
  - True/false or “choose the best explanation.”  
- **Small design reasoning items**  
  - “Two designs are shown. Which is safer and why?”  
  - “Which motor setup is more efficient in this situation?”

> Aim for questions that train **thinking like an engineer**, not just plugging numbers.

---

## 8. REFLECTION – “Alchemy of Systems”

### 8.1 Reflection Prompts (1–3)

Connect physics/engineering to **systems and balance**, for example:

- “Where do you see invisible forces at work in your daily life (wind, friction, tension, electricity)?”  
- “Think of a time when a system felt ‘out of balance’ (too much stress, not enough support).  
   What changed when it was brought back into balance?”  
- “How might understanding forces/energy help you design your own tools, routines, or spaces better?”

(These can be journaling prompts, either in a physical notebook or in the in-app journal.)

## 9. CONNECTION FORWARD

### 9.1 Where This Leads

- **Physics side:**
  - More advanced topics:  
    - Energy conservation  
    - Momentum  
    - Electromagnetism  
    - Waves / signals  

- **Engineering side:**
  - Mechanical engineering (machines, structures, robotics frames)  
  - Electrical engineering (circuits, power, control)  
  - Robotics (sensors, actuators, feedback loops)

You can also add:

- “In Grimora’s roadmap, this lesson prepares you for:  
  - `physeng_l1_02_...` and `physeng_l1_03_...`  
  - Later: basic robotics and simple design projects.”

## 10. MINI QUIZ

### 10.1 Quiz (3–5 questions)

- 1–2 conceptual questions  
- 1–2 simple numeric / diagram questions  
- 1 “engineer’s choice” question (pick best design or explanation)

Examples:

- “What is a force?” (choose best definition)  
- “If you double the force on the same mass, what happens to its motion (qualitatively)?”  
- “Which diagram shows balanced forces?”  

### 10.2 Answer Key

- Provide **short, clear answers** with 1-line reasoning:
  - “Answer: B – because the arrows are equal and opposite, so the net force is zero.”  
  - “Answer: 10 N – simple proportional reasoning …”
