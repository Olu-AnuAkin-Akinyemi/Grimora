- …  
- …  
- …

### 1.4 Key Terms & Simple Definitions

- **Term** – short, student-friendly definition  
- **Term** – short, student-friendly definition  

> [Deeper Study – Optional Key Term Note]  
> Use this only if there is extra context for advanced learners
> (e.g., historical naming, connection to logic, etc.).

## 2. NARRATIVE HOOK

### 2.1 Story / Metaphor (2–5 sentences)

- Everyday or **alchemy-flavored** scenario that shows the math idea as a transformation.  
- Should feel like it fits in the **Math Sanctum** of Grimora (Kimia, Ma’at, symbols, balance).

### 2.2 Why This Matters (Now & Later)

- 1–2 bullets about:
  - Daily life (money, time, sharing, measurement, etc.)  
  - Future chemistry / engineering / robotics (how this operation shows up later)

---

## 3. PRIOR KNOWLEDGE & WARM-UP

### 3.1 Assumed Prior Knowledge

- List 2–4 skills or ideas the learner should roughly have.  
  > e.g., “Can add and subtract within 20”, “Understands ‘more/less’.”

### 3.2 Quick Warm-Up (2–4 items)

- Very simple questions or visuals to reactivate prior knowledge.  
- Can be:
  - Quick mental math  
  - “Circle which is more/less”  
  - Small number line jumps

---

## 4. MAIN CONCEPT EXPLANATION

### 4.1 Intuitive Explanation

- Explain the idea in **everyday language** and pictures.  
- Use metaphors consistent with Grimora:
  - Transformations  
  - Energy, balance, scaling  
  - Simple sigil-like symbols

### 4.2 Formal / Semi-Formal Explanation

- Present:
  - Symbols, notation, simple rules.  
  - General forms (e.g., `a + b = c`, `a × b = c`, `a^n`).  
- Keep language at a **7th–10th grade** level.

> [Deeper Study – Formal Link]  
> Optional extra note that connects this to:
> - Later algebra / logic  
> - Historical naming  
> - Supreme Mathematic / Ma’at logic (as metaphor only)

### 4.3 Worked Examples (3–5)

For each example:

1. Short verbal setup (1–2 sentences)  
2. Expression or equation  
3. One–two line explanation of reasoning

_Example structure:_

- “You have 5 coins and find 2 more.”  
  - `5 + 2 = 7`  
  - Explanation: “We combine the two groups; total increases by 2.”

---

## 5. GUIDED PRACTICE (WITH HINTS)

### 5.1 Practice Set (4–8 items)

- The learner tries each problem.  
- Each item includes a short **hint** or guiding question.

_Example pattern:_

- `4 + 3 = ?`  
  - Hint: “Start at 4, count 3 steps forward.”  
- `24 ÷ 6 = ?`  
  - Hint: “How many 6s fit into 24?”

> Hints should **nudge strategy**, not give the full answer.

---

## 6. INDEPENDENT PRACTICE

### 6.1 Practice Set (6–10 items)

Mix:

- Straight calculations  
- Short word problems  
- 1–2 “explain your thinking” items

_Example types:_

- “Compute: `6 + 5`, `10 − 3`, `3 × 4`, `16 ÷ 4`”  
- “You have 12 apples and 3 friends. Share them equally. How many apples per friend?”  
- “Explain why subtraction is called the inverse of addition.”

---

## 7. REFLECTION – “ALCHEMY OF SELF”

### 7.1 Reflection Prompts (1–3)

- Link the **math idea** → personal habits, decisions, or mindset.  
- Use STEAM of Self style: gentle, self-observational, not moralizing.

_Example patterns:_

- “Name one habit you’d like to **add** to your day. One you’d like to **subtract**.”  
- “Where in your life do you **scale up** effort? Where do you need to **scale down**?”

---

## 8. CONNECTION FORWARD

### 8.1 Where This Leads (1–3 bullets)

- Name the **next math idea** this supports.  
- Name where it shows up in:
  - Chemistry (e.g., changing amounts in reactions)  
  - Physics / engineering (e.g., forces, scaling parts, circuits)  

_Example:_

- “Understanding addition and subtraction prepares you for solving equations, balancing chemical reactions, and keeping systems in balance.”

---

## 9. MINI QUIZ

### 9.1 Quiz (3–5 questions)

- Mix of:
  - 1–2 straightforward calculations  
  - 1–2 application or word questions  
  - 1 conceptual / “explain” question

### 9.2 Answer Key

- Short, clear answers, ideally all together at the bottom.  
- Can include 1–2 sentence explanations if needed.

## 10. Sigils & UI Hints (for Frontend / THREE.js Agent)

> This section is for the **product/UX/engineer agent**, not for learners.

- **Sigils Bar:**
  - Which pairs appear? (e.g., `+ / −`, `× / ÷`, `aⁿ / √a`)  
  - Any special state? (e.g., glow when Practice is opened or lesson completed)

- **Room / Hall Context:**
  - Confirm this lesson belongs to **Math Sanctum**.  
  - Optional: small geometry hint (dot, line, circle, triangle, etc. as tier marker).

---

## 11. PDF / Source Inspiration Map (for Content Agent)

> List which reference texts feed this specific lesson’s **metaphors** and **reflections**.  
> Do *not* copy them directly; use them as conceptual seeds.

- **Supreme Mathematic – African Ma’at Magic – African Creative Energy**  
  - Use for: Ma’at, balance, logic, number symbolism (as metaphor only).  

- **STEAM of SELF – Curriculum Outline**  
  - Use for: reflection prompts, habits, “engineering your future self.”  

- **Real Alchemy – Key Excerpts** (optional per lesson)  
  - Use for: transformation metaphors, “doing/undoing” ideas.  

- Any other PDFs can be listed here when relevant.
