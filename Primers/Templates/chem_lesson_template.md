## 2. NARRATIVE HOOK

### 2.1 Story / Metaphor (3–6 sentences)

- Everyday or Kimia-flavored scene, for example:
  - Steam rising from a pot, metal cooling after forging, sand turning to glass, a perfume spreading in air.  
- Gently hint at:
  - **Change**, **states**, **invisible particles**, or **transformation**.

### 2.2 Why This Matters (Now & Later)

- **Daily life:**  
  - 1–3 bullets: cooking, weather, materials, cleaning, etc.
- **Future chemistry / engineering / robotics:**  
  - 1–3 bullets: chemical reactions, materials choice, safety, process engineering.

---

## 3. PRIOR KNOWLEDGE & WARM-UP

### 3.1 Assumed Prior Knowledge

- List 2–4 ideas, e.g.:
  - Basic idea of “solid / liquid / gas” from everyday life.  
  - Simple counting and comparison of amounts (more/less).  
  - Maybe exposure to “particles” as a concept (optional).

### 3.2 Quick Warm-Up (2–4 items)

- Very simple prompts, like:
  - “Name something that is usually a solid / liquid / gas.”  
  - “What happens if you heat ice?”  
  - “What happens if you cool steam?”

> These warm-ups should activate intuition **before** introducing formal language.

## 4. MAIN CONCEPT EXPLANATION

### 4.1 Intuitive Explanation

- Explain using **everyday language and images**:
  - How matter feels (hard, soft, flowing),  
  - How it behaves (keeps shape, takes shape, spreads out).  
- Describe what learners **see / touch / experience**:
  - A rock vs water vs air; a metal spoon heating up, etc.

### 4.2 Scientific Explanation

- Introduce the **scientific idea**:
  - e.g., “Matter is anything that has mass and takes up space.”  
  - Atoms, particles (if appropriate for level).  
- Keep equations and symbols minimal at Level 1.  
- Emphasize **observable evidence** and **careful description**.

> [Deeper Study – Optional]  
> Add a short drop-down note with more detail:  
> e.g., atomic structure, simple particle diagrams, or how this connects to later physics (forces, energy).

### 4.3 Worked Examples (3–5)

Each example should include:

1. **Scenario / Question**  
   - “Is light matter? Is air matter? Why or why not?”  
2. **Reasoning**  
   - Use the definition (has mass, takes space) + examples.  
3. **Conclusion**  
   - Short, clear sentence.

Examples can cover:

- Classifying things as “matter / not matter”.  
- Distinguishing **substance** vs **object** (gently).  
- Simple state changes (ice → water → steam).

### 4.4 Simple Models & Diagrams (Optional)

- Sketch or describe:
  - Simple particle pictures for solid / liquid / gas.  
  - A basic way to visualize atoms or molecules (as spheres, not to scale).

---

## 5. GUIDED PRACTICE (WITH HINTS)

### 5.1 Practice Set (4–8 items)

- Classification questions:
  - “Matter or not?” (light, sound, air, rock, smell, etc.)  
- State questions:
  - “What state of matter is candle wax before, during, after burning?”

Include a short **hint** for each:

- “Does it have mass and take up space?”  
- “Think about whether you can hold it or if it fills space around you.”

---

## 6. INDEPENDENT PRACTICE

### 6.1 Practice Set (6–10 items)

Mix of:

- Short-answer items:
  - “Explain why air counts as matter even though you can’t see it.”  
- Categorization tasks:
  - Given a list of items, sort into solid/liquid/gas.  
- 1–2 “explain your thinking” prompts:
  - “Why is it useful for scientists and engineers to agree on what ‘matter’ means?”

---

## 7. REFLECTION – “Alchemy of Matter”

### 7.1 Reflection Prompts (1–3)

Connect chemistry to transformation and self-awareness, for example:

- “What’s one transformation of matter you see often (like cooking, freezing, rusting)?”  
- “How does paying attention to small changes in matter train your attention in other parts of life?”  
- “If you could carefully transform one ‘material’ in your habits (e.g., time spent scrolling → time spent creating), what would it be?”

(These can be journaling prompts, on paper or in-app.)

---

## 8. CONNECTION FORWARD

### 8.1 Where This Leads

- **Chemistry side:**
  - Atoms & molecules  
  - Elements & periodic table  
  - Simple reactions & conservation of mass  

- **Physics / Engineering side:**
  - How matter interacts with forces  
  - Materials in structures and machines  
  - Energy transfer (heating, cooling, phase changes)

You can also note:

- “In Grimora’s roadmap, this lesson prepares you for:  
  - `chem_l1_02_states-of-matter.md`  
  - `chem_l1_03_atoms-molecules.md`  
  - Early Physics + Engineering lessons in Machina Workshop.”

## 9. MINI QUIZ

### 9.1 Quiz (3–5 questions)

- 1–2 “matter or not” classification questions.  
- 1–2 state-of-matter questions.  
- 1 simple “definition in your own words” item.

### 9.2 Answer Key

- Provide **short, clear answers** with 1-line reasoning:
  - “Air is matter because it has mass and takes up space (you feel it as wind, it can be compressed).”  
  - “Light is not matter; it carries energy but doesn’t have mass in the same way.”

## 10. References / Source Inspiration (Optional)

- _Real Alchemy – key excerpts_ (historical Khemia → Alchemy → Chemistry; transformation themes).  
- _9 E.T.H.E.R._ (Shu/Tefnut & states of matter as symbolism – clearly marked as metaphor).  
- _STEAM of SELF – Curriculum Outline_ (reflection prompts, “Science of Self”).  
- _4_forces_summary_ (for later connection to what holds matter together – not Level 1 detail).
