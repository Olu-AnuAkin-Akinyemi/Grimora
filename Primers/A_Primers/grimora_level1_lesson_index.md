   - **File (suggested):** `Primers/Chem/chem_l1_01_what-is-matter.md`  
   - **Core Idea:**  
     Matter as “anything that has mass and takes up space”; early framing of solids, liquids, and gases with simple particle language and “alchemy of change” flavor.

   - **Lesson ID:** `chem-l1-02-states-of-matter`  
   - **File:** `Primers/Chem/chem_l1_02_states-of-matter.md`  
   - **Core Idea:**  
     Behavior of solids, liquids, gases (and a gentle intro to plasma); particle-level intuition plus everyday state changes and an engineering mini-project on designing for different states.

3. **Chem L1-03 – Atoms & Molecules: Invisible Building Blocks**  
   - **Lesson ID:** `chem-l1-03-atoms-molecules`  
   - **File (suggested):** `Primers/Chem/chem_l1_03_atoms-molecules.md`  
   - **Core Idea:**  
     Atoms, elements, and molecules as the small building blocks of matter; sets up future work on reactions, materials, and engineering design. (Uses Real Alchemy only as historical metaphor.)

## 3. Hall of Ma’at – Level 1  
**Theme:** Ma’at, Khemia, Trivium & Scientific Method  
**Module File(s):**  
- `Primers/Lore/lore_l1_maat-khemia-trivium.md`

### 3.1 Lesson List

1. **Lore L1-01 – Ma’at, Scales & Equation Balance**  
   - **Lesson ID:** `lore-l1-01-maat-balance-equations`  
   - **File (suggested):** `Primers/Lore/lore_l1_01_maat-balance-equations.md`  
   - **Core Idea:**  
     Ma’at as balance, truth, and right-measure; scales as visual metaphor for equation balance and fair trade; links emotional/ethical balance to math and force balance in physics.

2. **Lore L1-02 – From Khemia to Chemistry: Story, Experiment, Method**  
   - **Lesson ID:** `lore-l1-02-khemia-to-chemistry-method`  
   - **File (suggested):** `Primers/Lore/lore_l1_02_khemia-to-chemistry-method.md`  
   - **Core Idea:**  
     Historical arc: Khem/Khemia → Al-Kīmiyā’ → European alchemy → modern chemistry; focuses on how trial-and-error became structured experiment (hypothesis, observation, iteration).

   - **Quadrivium Lens:** Geometry (shapes, distances, levers)  
   - **Core Idea:**  
     Forces as pushes/pulls, balanced vs unbalanced; levers and ramps as simple machines that help use forces more effectively; strong tie to Ma’at and equation balance.

2. **PhysEng L1-02 – Work, Distance & Mechanical Advantage (Conceptual)**  
   - **Lesson ID:** `physeng-l1-02-work-distance-mech-advantage`  
   - **File:** `Primers/PhysEng/physeng_l1_02_work-distance-mech-advantage.md`  
   - **Quadrivium Lens:** Geometry (paths, slopes)  
   - **Core Idea:**  
     Conceptual “work” as force over distance; mechanical advantage as trading less force for more distance; ramps and levers as concrete examples, with links to math scaling.

   - **Core Idea:**  
     Complex machines and robots as combinations of simple machines plus sensors, actuators, and control; introduces mechanisms and basic robot thinking (forces + information).

## 6. Notes for Future Implementation

- These lesson IDs can be used directly in:
  - `js/data/lessons.js` as primary keys.
  - `js/data/roadmap.js` for sequencing/unlocks.
  - Cross-Hall navigation (e.g., “related lessons” sidebars in the app).

- Each lesson file already:
  - Follows its Hall’s template (Math / Chem / Lore / PhysEng).  
  - Includes a **Cross-Links** section connecting to other Halls.  

- Level 1 is now a complete “ring” of:
  - Foundations (Math + Chem)  
  - Framing (Lore / Ma’at / Trivium / Khemia)  
  - Application glimpse (PhysEng / early robotics)
